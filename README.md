# hackathon_2017_7
"the week" hackathon of July 2017 - problems and solutions

well, I was invited to this small hackathon that a friend of mine was organizing. and he asked me to help him put some problems that are suitable for the event. so I gave him some data and we put some problems.
this repo is dedicated to the script I wrote to get some answers so I can compare to when at the judging stage. which I am sharing mainly for the participants to see.

you can find the problems listed in the script.
the data is a sample of a CDR of a call center that recieves calls from customers:
1- call date
2- customer ID
3- employee ID
4- total duration
5- talk time
6- status

disclaimer: - this is not the best way to solve the problems
            - this is not the fastest also
            - this solution may not work on other data sets, I did not account for that as my needs were the final answer
